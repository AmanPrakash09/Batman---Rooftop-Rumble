# Batman - Rooftop Rumble


## Take on the mantle of Batman!

Fight through the deadly ninjas of the *League of Shadows* and stop them from terrorizing the citizens
of Gotham City! Play as **Batman** as he rushes to a rooftop to deliver some crime-fighting justice! Fight through the enemies using Batman's gadgets and martial arts expertise.

This is an action-packed 2D-platformer.
The game will include a levelled map which will allow the player to traverse through different layers.
The enemy ninjas spawn at different locations and try to attack Batman using melee attacks.
The player will be able to punch away at enemies while being able to jump, drop, and glide to 
different surfaces.
At the end of each game, the player will be shown their score and will be prompted to enter their name.
This will be saved to a high score similar to an arcade game.
