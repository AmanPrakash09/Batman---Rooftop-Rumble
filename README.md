# Batman - Rooftop Rumble


## Take on the mantle of Batman!

Fight through the deadly ninjas of the *League of Shadows* and stop them from terrorizing the citizens
of Gotham City! Play as **Batman** as he rushes to a rooftop to deliver some crime-fighting justice! Fight through the enemies using Batman's gadgets and martial arts expertise.

This is an action-packed 2D-platformer.
The game will include a levelled map which will allow the player to traverse through different layers.
The enemy ninjas spawn at different locations and try to attack Batman using melee attacks.
The player will be able to punch away at enemies while being able to jump, drop, and glide to 
different surfaces.
At the end of each game, the player will be shown their score and will be prompted to enter their name.
This will be saved to a high score similar to an arcade game.

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by completing the game, 
  entering your name in the text field at the bottom of the Scoreboard panel, and then clicking the
  "Add Score" button. This will add your name and score to the displayed Scoreboard. 
- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the "Remove Score" button.
  This removes the score you just added to the Scoreboard. This can only be done after adding your score in the 
  first required action.
- You can locate my visual component by going to the Main class in the UI folder of my project. This will launch 
  the GUI of my project.
- You can save the state of my application by pressing 's' while playing the game. Then, a splash screen will
appear prompting the user if they are sure they want to save the game (Yes/No options).

# Phase 4: Task 3

Looking at my UML diagram at the end of the term, I see that I did not utilize any interfaces or abstract classes. I noticed that there are instances where I could have avoided repetitive code and could have used a more elegant solution. For example, I have a "Roof" and "Ground" class that both function as a surface. I could have made an abstract class called "Surface" where I have basic implementation that "puts Batman on a surface." I could have then had both "Ground" and "Roof" extend "Surface" where the difference would be that Batman could not drop from the ground. I could have also made a regular class called “Ground” that was extended by “Roof” where “Roof” would override that Batman could drop from it. I could also have done the opposite where “Ground” overrides “Roof” and does not allow Batman to drop from it. Currently, I handle all my collisions in the “Game” class so I could have simply made a “Surface” class instead of both a “Ground” and “Roof” class. Then, I could have instantiated a “Surface” with the name “ground” that did not allow Batman to drop from it. I prefer the idea of making an abstract “Surface” class since then I could make other types of surfaces in the future like where Batman is slowed, gets damaged, or sinks.

I also see that I made JsonWriter and JsonReader along with JsonWriterScoreboard and JsonReaderScoreboard. These classes have almost the exact same functionality except JsonWriter and JsonReader help with the data persistence of saving and loading the game while JsonWriterScoreboard and JsonReaderScoreboard help with keeping a record of all the players with their respective scores. I could have made JsonWriterScoreboard and JsonReaderScoreboard extend JsonWriter and JsonReader respectively where JsonWriterScoreboard and JsonReaderScoreboard override a scoreboard being saved and loaded to and from a JSON file instead of a game. I could have also used an abstract class in this scenario where all 4 classes extended it. Since JsonWriter, JsonReader, JsonWriterScoreboard, and JsonReaderScoreboard all have the same behavior, I could have also used an interface where the 4 classes would implement it.

Instead of making a “Batman” class, I would have made an abstract “Character” class. This would allow me to create other character classes like “Robin” that would extend “Character” along with “Batman.” This would allow the user to select which character they want to play as during the game. Each character could also have different attacks, animations, and sprites. Similar to this idea, I would also have made an abstract “Projectiles” class so that based on the character the user selected, a certain long-range attack could be used. For example, with “Batman,” a Batarang from the “Batarang” class would have been thrown but with “RedHood,” the user could shoot a gun using a hypothetical “Gun” class.

I would also remove the “TerminalGame” class completely from my design. Though learning how to use semi-graphical user interfaces in a text-only environment was interesting, I wish I could have started the project using Swing since I had to redo my work for Phase 1 in Phase 3. Considering features I want to add (not required for this task), I would want to implement different levels with each one getting progressively more challenging with enemy ninjas spawning at random locations on the screen. Along with this, I would want to add boss battles with “Boss” being an abstract class. Different comic villains would then extend this class and would have unique attacks, animations, hitboxes, and so on. Due to the fast-paced nature of this course, I did not have the opportunity to explore making my game more appealing. In the future, I would definitely want to add background images, animations, and sound effects.
