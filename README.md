# Batman - Rooftop Rumble


## Take on the mantle of Batman!

Fight through the deadly ninjas of the *League of Shadows* and stop a rampaging *Bane* from terrorizing the citizens
of Gotham City! Play as **Batman** as he rushes to a rooftop where he encounters Bane who plans on infecting Gotham with
Scarecrow's Fear Toxin. Fight through the waves of enemies using Batman's gadgets and martial arts expertise.

This is an action-packed 2D-platformer.
The game will include a levelled map which will allow the player to traverse through different layers.
The enemy ninjas spawn at different locations and either use melee or long range attacks.
At the end, the player will be put in a boss battle with Bane who will have a range of attacks that deal heavy damage.
The player will be able to punch and throw Batarangs at enemies while being able to jump, drop, grapple, and glide to 
different surfaces.
At the end of each game, the player will be shown their score and will be prompted to enter their name.
This will be saved and a high score screen will appear similar to an arcade game.
